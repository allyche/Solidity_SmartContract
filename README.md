# Module 20 Challenage

My team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. My smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## The following steps were carried out:
1. The completed Solidity JointSavings smart contract.
2. Compiled and deployed my contract in the JavaScript VM.
3. Interact with my deployed smart contract.
2. A folder named Execution_Results that contains six images. In addition to setting account, these images confirms 3 deposit and 2 withdrawal transactions, which are designed to test the JointSavings functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected.

## Results
Please refer to folder Execution_Results.
